                We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which
                we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to
                use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the
                original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how
                the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the
                original purpose, please contact us.

                If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose,

                <li>
                  Service providers acting as processors based in the UK who
                  provide IT and system administration services, and who provide
                  delivery and courier services.

                  Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge
                  parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may
                  seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a
                  change happens to our business, then the new owners may use
                  your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy
                  policy.

              </ul>

                We require all third parties to respect the security of your

                not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal

              <h3 className="font-bold">6. International transfers</h3>
              <p>
                Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we
                ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by
                ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is
                implemented:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  We will only transfer your personal data to countries that
                  have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection
                  for personal data by the European Commission. For further
                  details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection
                  of personal data in non-EU countries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific
                  contracts approved by the European Commission which give
                  personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For
                  further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for
                  the transfer of personal data to third countries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data
                  to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires
                  them to provide similar protection to personal data shared
                  between Europe and the US. For further details, see European
                  Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.
                </li>
              </ul>

                Please contact us if you want further information on the
                specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal
                data out of the EEA.
              </p>
              <h3 className="font-bold">7. Data security</h3>
              <p>
                We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent
                your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or
                accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In
                addition, we limit access to your personal data to those
                employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have
                a business need to know. They will only process your personal
                data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
                confidentiality.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected
                personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable
                regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
              </p>
              <h3 className="font-bold">8. Data retention</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>How long will you use my personal data for?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably
                necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including
                for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax,
                accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your
                personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or
                if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in
                respect to our relationship with you.
              </p>
              <p>
                To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data,
                we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal
                data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or
                disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we
                process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
                purposes through other means, and the applicable legal,
                regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                By law we have to keep basic information about our customers
                (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data)
                for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see
                below for further information.
              </p>
              <p>
                In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so
                that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or
                statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information
                indefinitely without further notice to you.
              </p>
              <h3 className="font-bold">9. Your legal rights</h3>
              <p>
                Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data
                protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the
                right to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a
                  "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a
                  copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that
                  we are lawfully processing it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Request correction of the personal data that we hold about
                  you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate
                  data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify
                  the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask
                  us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good
                  reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the
                  right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where
                  you have successfully exercised your right to object to
                  processing (see below), where we may have processed your
                  information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your
                  personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we
                  may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure
                  for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if
                  applicable, at the time of your request.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Object to processing of your personal data where we are
                  relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party)
                  and there is something about your particular situation which
                  makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you
                  feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You
                  also have the right to object where we are processing your
                  personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we
                  may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to
                  process your information which override your rights and
                  freedoms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This
                  enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your
                  personal data in the following scenarios:
                  <ul>
                    <li>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.</li>
                    <li>
                      Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want
                      us to erase it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer
                      require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend
                      legal claims.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      You have objected to our use of your data but we need to
                      verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to
                      use it.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a
                  third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have
                  chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
                  machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to
                  automated information which you initially provided consent for
                  us to use or where we used the information to perform a
                  contract with you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent
                  to process your personal data. However, this will not affect
                  the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you
                  withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may
                  not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We
                  will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw
                  your consent.
                </li>

              <p>
                If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please

                <strong>No fee usually required</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or
                to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a
                reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive
                or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your
                request in these circumstances.

              <p>
                We may need to request specific information from you to help us
                confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your
                personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is
                a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed
                to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also
                contact you to ask you for further information in relation to
                your request to speed up our response.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Time limit to respond</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
                Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your
                request is particularly complex or you have made a number of
                requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
